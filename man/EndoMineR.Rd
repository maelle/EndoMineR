\title{EndoMineR: A package for analysis of endoscopic and related pathology}
\description{
The goal of EndoMineR is to extract as much information as possible from
endoscopy reports and their associated pathology specimens. The package
is intended for use by gastroenterologists, pathologists and anyone
interested in the analysis of endoscopic and ppathological datasets
Gastroenterology now has many standards against which practice is measured
although many reporting systems do not include the reporting capability to
give anything more than basic analysis. Much of the data is locked in
semi-structured text.However the nature of semi-structured text means that
data can be extracted in a standardised way- it just requires more
manipulation. This package provides that manipulation so that complex
endoscopic-pathological analyses, in line with recognised standards for
these analyses, can be done.The package is basically in three parts/
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item The extraction- This is really when the data is provided as full text
reports. You may already have the data in a spreadsheet in which case
this part isn't necessary.

\item Cleaning- These are a group of functions
that allow the user to extract and clean data commonly found in endoscopic
and pathology reports. The cleaning functions usually remove common typos or
extraneous information and do some reformatting.

\item  Analyses- The analyses provide graphing function as well as analyses
according to the cornerstone questions in gastroenterology- namely
surveillance, patient tracking, quality of endoscopy and pathology
reporting and diagnostic yield questions.
