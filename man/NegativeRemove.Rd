or as a way of providing a 'positive diagnosis only' type output (see
HistolDx)

"Although the prep was poor,there was no adenoma found",
"The colon was basically inflammed, but no polyp was seen",
"The Barrett's segment was not biopsied",
"The C0M7 stretch of Barrett's was flat")
anexample<-data.frame(anexample)
names(anexample)<-"Thecol"
# Run the function on the dataframe and it should get rid of sentences (and
# parts of sentences) with negative parts in them.
hh<-NegativeRemove(anexample$Thecol)
