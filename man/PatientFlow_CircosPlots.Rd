\title{Create a Circos plot for patient flow}
\usage{
PatientFlow_CircosPlots(dataframe, Endo_ResultPerformed, HospNum_Id,
  ProcPerformed)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataframe}{dataframe}

\item{Endo_ResultPerformed}{the column containing the date of the procedure}

\item{HospNum_Id}{Column with the patient's unique hospital number}

\item{ProcPerformed}{The procedure that you want to plot (eg EMR,
radiofrequency ablation for Barrett's but can be
any dscription of a procedure you desire)}
}
\description{
This allows us to look at the overall flow from one
type of procedure to another using circos plots. A good example of it's 
use might be to see how patients move from one state (e.g. having an
EMR), to another state (e.g. undergoing RFA)
}
\examples{
# This function builds a circos plot which gives a more aggregated
# overview of how patients flow from one state to another than the
# SurveySankey function
# Build a list of procedures
Event <- list(
  x1 = "Therapeutic- Dilatation",
  x2 = "Other-", x3 = "Surveillance",
  x4 = "APC", x5 = "Therapeutic- RFA TTS",
  x5 = "Therapeutic- RFA 90",
  x6 = "Therapeutic- EMR", x7 = "Therapeutic- RFA 360"
)
EndoEvent <- replicate(2000, sample(Event, 1, replace = FALSE))
# Merge the list with the Myendo dataframe
fff <- unlist(EndoEvent)
fff <- data.frame(fff)
names(fff) <- "col1"
Myendo <- cbind(fff$col1, Myendo)
names(Myendo)[names(Myendo) == "HospitalNumber"] <- "PatientID"
names(Myendo)[names(Myendo) == "fff$col1"] <- "EndoEvent"
# Myendo$EndoEvent<-as.character(Myendo$EndoEvent)
# Run the function using the procedure information (the date of the
# procedure, the Event type and the individual patient IDs)
hh <- PatientFlow_CircosPlots(Myendo, "Dateofprocedure", "PatientID", "EndoEvent")
