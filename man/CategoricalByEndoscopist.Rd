\title{Plot a frequency table for categorical variables by endoscopist}
\usage{
CategoricalByEndoscopist(ProportionColumn, EndoscopistColumn)
}
\arguments{
\item{ProportionColumn}{The column (categorical data) of interest}

\item{EndoscopistColumn}{The endoscopist column}
}
\description{
This takes any of the numerical metrics in the dataset and plots it by
endoscopist.
It of course relies on a Endoscopist column being present
}
\examples{
#The function plots any numeric metric by endoscopist
# Mypath demo dataset. These functions are all part of Histology data
# cleaning as part of the package.
v<-HistolDx(Mypath,'Diagnosis')
v$NumBx<-HistolNumbOfBx(v$Macroscopicdescription,'specimen')
v$BxSize<-HistolBxSize(v$Macroscopicdescription)
# The histology is then merged with the Endoscopy dataset. The merge occurs
# according to date and Hospital number
v<-Endomerge2(Myendo,'Dateofprocedure','HospitalNumber',v,'Dateofprocedure',
'HospitalNumber')
#The function relies on the other Barrett's functions being run as well:
b1<-Barretts_PragueScore(v,'Findings')
b2<-Barretts_PathStage(b1,'Histology')
# The follow-up group depends on the histology and the Prague score for a
# patient so it takes the processed Barrett's data and then looks in the
# Findings column for permutations of the Prague score.
b4<-Barretts_FUType(b2,"CStage","MStage","IMorNoIM")
colnames(b4)[colnames(b4) == 'pHospitalNum'] <- 'HospitalNumber'
# The function takes the column with the extracted worst grade of
# histopathology and returns the proportion of each finding (ie
# proportion with low grade dysplasia, high grade etc.) for each
# endoscopist
kk<-CategoricalByEndoscopist(b4$IMorNoIM,b4$Endoscopist)
rm(Myendo)
