\title{Paris vs histopath Barrett's}
\usage{
BarrettsParisEMR(Column, Column2)
}
\arguments{
\item{Column}{Endoscopy report field of interest as a string vector}

\item{Column2}{Another endoscopy report field of interest as a string vector}
}
\value{
a string vector
}
\description{
This looks at the Paris grades of each EMR and then creates a heatmap
of pathological grade vs
endoscopic Paris grade.This should only be run after all the
BarrettsDataAccord functions.
}
\examples{
# Firstly relevant columns are extrapolated from the
# Mypath demo dataset. These functions are all part of Histology data
# cleaning as part of the package.
v<-Mypath
v<-HistolDx(v,'Diagnosis')
# The histology is then merged with the Endoscopy dataset. The merge occurs
# according to date and Hospital number
v<-Endomerge2(Myendo,'Dateofprocedure','HospitalNumber',v,'Dateofprocedure',
'HospitalNumber')
#The function relies on the other Barrett's functions being run as well:
b1<-Barretts_PragueScore(v,'Findings')
b2<-Barretts_PathStage(b1,'Histology')
# The follow-up group depends on the histology and the Prague score for a
# patient so it takes the processed Barrett's data and then looks in the
# Findings column for permutations of the Prague score.
b4<-Barretts_FUType(b2,"CStage","MStage","IMorNoIM")
colnames(b4)[colnames(b4) == 'pHospitalNum'] <- 'HospitalNumber'
# The function compares the Paris score 
# from the endoscopy report free text to
# the histopathology scores for the same endoscopies so you can see what the
# lesion recognition is like overall
mm<-BarrettsParisEMR(b4,"ProcedurePerformed","Findings")
